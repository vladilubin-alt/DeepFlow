# DeepFlow QA Report
**Date:** June 28, 2026
**Tester:** MiMoCode (Automated QA)
**App:** DeepFlow — ADHD Writing Instrument
**Platforms:** Web (Netlify), Android (APK)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overall Pass Rate:** 72% (54/75 tests passed)

### Issues by Severity
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 3 |
| HIGH | 5 |
| MEDIUM | 8 |
| LOW | 5 |
| INFO | 4 |

### Top 3 Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **CRITICAL: API endpoints exposed without authentication** — profiles, writing_sessions, and graveyard tables return HTTP 200 without auth tokens. Any user can read all data.
2. **CRITICAL: No Privacy Policy** — Required for app store compliance and GDPR/CCPA. Legal risk.
3. **CRITICAL: Android debuggable=true** — App is in debug mode. Must be false for production builds.
